📽️ Greencycles Movie Rental System 🚴‍♂️
Welcome to Greencycles, a movie rental company! This README explains the key operations in the system, which are divided into three main sections: Data Definition, Data Manipulation, and Managing Views.

📚 1. Data Definition (DDL) 🔧
CREATE TABLE: This is used to define the structure of tables in the database, such as directors, films, customers, and more.
INSERT INTO: Adds new data to the tables. For example, we can insert customer details, sales records, or feedback.
ALTER TABLE: Allows modifications to the table structure, such as adding new columns, changing column types, or renaming them.

🛠️ 2. Data Manipulation (DML) ✏️
UPDATE: Modifies existing data in specific rows. For example, updating a customer's name or email address.
DELETE FROM: Deletes specific rows from a table based on a condition. For example, removing a particular payment record.
These operations help maintain and update the data within the tables, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.

🔄 3. Managing Views 👀
CREATE VIEW: This creates a virtual table from a query result, simplifying complex queries and improving data access.
CREATE TABLE AS: Creates a new physical table based on a query result.
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW: Stores the results of a query as physical data, making it faster to retrieve but needing to be refreshed periodically.
ALTER VIEW, DROP VIEW, CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW: These operations allow modifications to, removal of, or complete replacement of existing views, helping manage dynamic data access.

🏁 Conclusion
The Greencycles Movie Rental System uses SQL to define, manipulate, and manage data effectively. These operations help organize movie rental information, customer details, sales transactions, and feedback, making the system efficient and flexible for both the customers and administrators.
